## Usage examples

### Analytics Builder Models

List all Analytics Builder models:
```
c8y analytics ab list
```

Download a specific Analytics Builder model:
```
c8y analytics ab get --id 5379731810 --outputFileRaw iir.json
```

Upload a new Analytics Builder model:
```
c8y analytics ab create --name iir2 --template iir.json
```

Update the state of an Analytics Builder model:
```
c8y analytics ab update --id 1579830237 --state ACTIVE
```

Delete an Analytics Builder model:
```
c8y analytics ab delete --id 1579830237
```

### EPL Apps

EPL Apps support the same commands, like Analytics Builder models. For example, to list all EPL Apps:

List all EPL Apps:
```
c8y analytics epl list --includeAll
```

**Note:** The list of Analytics Builder models always includes all models, whereas the list EPL Apps uses pagination.

### Analytics Builder Template Models
Template models are a way to parameterize models and then create multiple instances with different values for these parameters.

List all instances of a template model:
```
c8y analytics instances list --id 2579780855
```

Update an instance of a template model:
```
c8y analytics instances update --id 2579780855 --instanceId 9579789317 --mode PRODUCTION
```
**Note:** This command is mostly useful to apply state and mode changes. While changes to parameter values are possible it requires to provide all parameters via the --data flag.

Delete an instance of a template model:
```
c8y analytics instances delete --id 2579780855 --instanceId 9579789317
```

### Management
These commands provide control over the Apama microservice that provides the Streaming Analytics capabilities of Cumulocity.

Restart the Apama microservice (e.g. after deploying custom blocks):
```
c8y analytics management restart
```

Get full diagnostics of the Apama microservice (the command uses the file name provided by the Apama microservice):
```
c8y analytics management diagnosticsEnhanced --outputFileRaw "{filename}" > /dev/null
```

Configure the delay used for reordering and ignoring data. For details refer to the documentation on [Input blocks and event timing](https://cumulocity.com/docs/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/#input-blocks-and-event-timing).
```
c8y analytics management timedelay_secs --delay 10
```

In addition, commands exist to configure the number of client the Apama microservice uses to interact with Cumulocity and the number of worker threads Analytics Builder uses.

### Analytics Extensions

Analytics extensions are used to deploy custom blocks for Analytics Builder and other customizations into the Apama microservice. They can be built using the [Apama Analytics Builder Block SDK](https://github.com/Cumulocity-IoT/apama-analytics-builder-block-sdk).

List all Analytics extensions:
```
c8y analytics extensions list --includeAll
```

Get the details of an individual Analytics extension by id:
```
c8y analytics extensions get --id 1779829394
```

Delete an Analytics extension:
```
c8y analytics extensions delete --id 1779829394
```

Download an Analytics extension:
```
c8y analytics extensions download --id 1179099345 --outputFileRaw MyBlocks.zip  > /dev/null
```


Upload an Analytics extension built with the Block SDK:
```
c8y analytics extensions upload --file MyBlocks.zip --verbose --name MyBlocks --pas_extension MyBlocks
```
